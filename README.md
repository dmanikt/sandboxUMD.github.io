Just a few rules when working with this project

<strong>NEVER</strong> push to master. Please create a new branch with the command 
`git checkout -b NEWBRANCHNAME`

Once you make your changes, push by doing `git push -u origin NEWNBRANCHNAME`

Then, submit a pull request for someone to go over, and THEN it will be merged into master.

Do message Ishaan on FB or text at 240 498 5209 with any questions.
