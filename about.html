          <div class="topic">General</div>
          <div class="spacerForty"></div>
          <div class="question">What is Sandbox?</div>
          <div class="answer">Sandbox is a student-run space where anyone can make anything. We encourage anyone of any skill level to have a place to learn, discover, and create.</div>

          <div class="question">Who runs this space?</div>
          <div class="answer">Sandbox is run by students and supported by faculty in the computer science department. Student organizers make the space operate, and CS faculty make the space possible.</div>

          <div class="question">Who can work in Sandbox?</div>
          <div class="answer">We welcome people from all disciplines and backgrounds. The most exciting work comes from people of different fields coming together to collaborate and try new things.</div>

          <div class="question">What can I do in Sandbox?</div>
          <div class="answer">Anything! Sandbox is a productive space that aims to provide resources to enable you to make or do whatever kind of creative project you want. We want to be as flexible as possible, so if there’s something we’re missing that you think could make the space better and more useful, add it to our suggestions list!</div>

          <div class="question">Where is Sandbox?</div>
          <div class="answer">Sandbox is located in IRB 1231, the second floor of the new Brenden Iribe Center. Go up the elevator and go straight. We are at the end of the hall.</div>

          <div class="question">What does it cost me to use Sandbox?</div>
          <div class="answer">It’s free! The goal of Sandbox is to put the ability to make things in the hands of every student, so we provide our resources free of cost. We do have some consumable resources available to use in your projects, but we ask you to use them courteously; leave enough for everyone! If you have a project that would use up most or all of Sandbox’s supply of a consumable, please provide your own. </div>
          <div class="spacerSixty"></div>


          <div class="topic">Management</div>
          <div class="spacerForty"></div>
          <div class="question">Who are the managers?</div>
          <div class="answer">Managers are students who have demonstrated a committed interest in using, mentoring in, and maintaining the space.</div>

          <div class="question">What do managers do?</div>
          <div class="answer">You don’t have to be a member to hack or learn at Sandbox. Being a manager means you’re committed to actively maintaining and improving the Sandbox space and community. Managers receive swipe access to the space so they can open the door for the public to use the space. Keeping the space open to the public is the main function of managers. Managers are also encouraged to represent Sandbox and promote the space at various events, other makerspaces, etc.</div>

          <div class="question">How can I become a Sandbox manager?</div>
          <div class="answer">A student must be an active user of Sandbox for at least one month and have demonstrated an interest in improving the community. Then, they can apply for manager-ship.</div>
          <div class="spacerSixty"></div>


          <div class="topic">Accessing Sandbox</div>
          <div class="spacerForty"></div>
          <div class="question">Do I need to be a manager of Sandbox to access it?</div>
          <div class="answer">Nope! Anyone can work in Sandbox whenever a manager is present.</div>

          <div class="question">What are the hours of Sandbox, and how can I get in?</div>
          <div class="answer">Sandbox is open whenever managers are present. Our offical hours are 2pm - 8pm Mondays to Fridays.</div>

          <div class="question">How can I find out if Sandbox is currently open?</div>
          <div class="answer">Soon you’ll be able to check in on our website to see if the door is open or closed. Check in soon for more details on this.</div>

          <div class="question">How do I get swipe access?</div>
          <div class="answer">Only managers have swipe access. There should be enough managers that Sandbox is either always open or can be opened by a manager when you need it. However, if you want swipe access and the other responsibilities of a manager, you can apply for manager-ship.</div>

          <div class="question">What if I want to use the space but there’s no managers present?</div>
          <div class="answer">If Sandbox is closed, you can try posting in the Facebook page (facebook.com/groups/SandboxUMD) to see if any managers are planning on coming by.</div>
          <div class="spacerSixty"></div>


          <div class="topic">Tools + Space</div>
          <div class="spacerForty"></div>
          <div class="question">Which tools can I use?</div>
          <div class="answer">You can use any of our tools, although some of the power tools require a quick safety certification.</div>

          <div class="question">Can I take materials and tools out of the room?</div>
          <div class="answer">Tools should not be taken out of the room. If anyone is in Sandbox at any time and wants to use a tool, it should always be there. Our consumable materials can leave the room if it’s a part of a project you’ve built. We prefer that you don’t walk off with individual components and pieces to go work on your project elsewhere. We don’t want to be a free parts catalog.</div>

          <div class="question">Can I move furniture around?</div>
          <div class="answer">Yes! We encourage you to adapt the space to meet the needs of whatever you’re trying to do. Just make sure that what you’re doing doesn’t get in the way of other people trying to use the space. If you’re moving a table, check the underside of the table and make sure the power strip isn’t plugged into anything.</div>

          <div class="question">Can I leave my project here?</div>
          <div class="answer">We have lockers that you can check out to store smaller projects. Just ask the manager in the room and we’ll get you set up. We also have a project room where you can store larger projects. However, security cannot be guaranteed.</div>
